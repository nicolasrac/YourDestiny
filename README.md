# YourDestiny

By Nicolás J. Rodríguez, Sebastián Pedroza and Nicolás Vigoya

this is an alpha version of my final project.  It is a text game about the destiny of your life based on your decisions.

If you want to run the code, you go to the file called "Juego.py" and run it from there.

Sometimes it gives the error that it cannot find the file "destiny.txt", but it can be fixed by creating a new text file inside the main folder. 
Then copy and paste the contents of "destiny.txt" into the new text file with the name you want.

If you make this change, you must go to "Juego.py", and change Ln 13, Col 15, to the name of the newly assigned text file.

Enjoy!
